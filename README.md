Hi gentlemen of the ladies!
i'm so excited to learn Deep-Learning using the fast-ai library, i hope by the end of this program running live from brisbane Australia i will be doing a lot of cool stuffs.
i have got my interest in the area of the computer vision and working with the group 13 cv-online team on self-driving cars.
